#JS Week 1 Code Review - GitHub Search

###By: Taylor Pokoj

##Description

For this project, we were instructed to create a website where the user can enter a GitHub username into a form and submit it to see names and descriptions of that person's public repositories. The website should meet the following objectives:

- Manage your build tool dependencies with npm
- Manage your front-end dependencies with Bower
- Include a gulp-based asset pipeline with a development server.
- The app should be structured in a logical way, including some SASS and at least 2 JavaScript files.
- Use exports in at least one of your JavaScript files
- It should make an AJAX request and parse the JSON response.

##Installation

Install Arctic Wild locally by cloning this repository:

https://github.com/pokojt/githubSearch.git

After cloning, initialize and install the Node and Bower packages by running $npm init, $npm install, $bower init, and $bower install in the terminal. Run $gulp build and $gulp serve when installation is complete to run the project in your local server.

You will need an API key from the GitHub API to use this project. Create an .env folder in the top level of the project, containing the following code:

exports.apiKey = "YOUR_API_HERE";
